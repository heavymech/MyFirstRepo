            <h3>about:</h3>
            <p id="about1">
                Tasslehoff was born in Kendermore. His Uncle Trapspringer is a hero
                among the kender race. Tas claims that most of his skills
                (such as use of a hoopak, tracking, mapmaking, etc) were taught to
                him by his Uncle Trapspringer. Tasslehoff, like all kender,
                is very curious, carefree, and fearless. They’re considered the
                “nuisance” race of Krynn. Not much is known about Tas’s
                childhood except for little bits he brings up from seemingly out
                of nowhere.

            <p id="about2">
                During Tas’s Wanderlust, a kender rite of passage, he ended up in Solace during a festival. He stumbled
                upon the unattended
                booth of Flint Fireforge, who was selling his wares that day. Tas spotted a shiny copper bracelet in the
                booth’s glass case
                and somehow it ended up in his possession. Tas was caught red-handed in the act which is how he met
                Flint and Tanis. Their
                first adventure was to return that bracelet to the Dargonesti elf princess who commissioned Flint to
                craft it. It had the
                power to show its wearer the near future and was vital to the preservation of the Dargonesti race.

            <p id="about3">
                Tasslehoff enjoyed traveling with the companions so much that he was always with them (except when he
                wanderer off for weeks
                without notice). He was especially close to Flint. Flint, however, thought Tas was an annoyance and was
                responsible for most
                of the trouble they found (which was true most of the time). Flint came to like Tas a lot although he
                rarely showed it.

            <p class="about4">
                Tasslehoff once became evil after he, Caramon, and Sturm were captured by minotaurs. A high priest of
                the minotaurs kept
                Tas drugged with a special potion that made him evil so that he would reveal information about his
                friends. It was a minotaur
                that saved him by giving him a dose of another potion instead of the evil one. Tas had befriended this
                minotaur, named Dogz,
                when Tas was captured and imprisoned.
