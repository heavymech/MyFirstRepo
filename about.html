                <p id="about1">
                    Tasslehoff was born in Kendermore. His Uncle Trapspringer is a hero
                    among the kender race. Tas claims that most of his skills
                    (such as use of a hoopak, tracking, mapmaking, etc) were taught to
                    him by his Uncle Trapspringer. Tasslehoff, like all kender,
                    is very curious, carefree, and fearless. They’re considered the
                    “nuisance” race of Krynn. Not much is known about Tas’s
                    childhood except for little bits he brings up from seemingly out
                    of nowhere.

                    During Tas’s Wanderlust, a kender rite of passage, he ended up in Solace during a festival. He
                    stumbled
                    upon the unattended
                    booth of Flint Fireforge, who was selling his wares that day. Tas spotted a shiny copper bracelet in
                    the
                    booth’s glass case
                    and somehow it ended up in his possession. Tas was caught red-handed in the act which is how he met
                    Flint and Tanis. Their
                    first adventure was to return that bracelet to the Dargonesti elf princess who commissioned Flint to
                    craft it. It had the
                    power to show its wearer the near future and was vital to the preservation of the Dargonesti race.

                    Tasslehoff enjoyed traveling with the companions so much that he was always with them (except when
                    he
                    wanderer off for weeks
                    without notice). He was especially close to Flint. Flint, however, thought Tas was an annoyance and
                    was
                    responsible for most
                    of the trouble they found (which was true most of the time). Flint came to like Tas a lot although
                    he
                    rarely showed it.

                    Tasslehoff once became evil after he, Caramon, and Sturm were captured by minotaurs. A high priest
                    of
                    the minotaurs kept
                    Tas drugged with a special potion that made him evil so that he would reveal information about his
                    friends. It was a minotaur
                    that saved him by giving him a dose of another potion instead of the evil one. Tas had befriended
                    this
                    minotaur, named Dogz,
                    when Tas was captured and imprisoned.
